/** An %OutputPort belongs to a System and represents the properties of one of
that System's output ports. %OutputPort objects are assigned OutputPortIndex
values in the order they are declared; these are unique within a single System.

An output port can be considered a "window" into a System that permits
controlled exposure of one of the values contained in that System's Context at
run time. Input ports of other subsystems may be connected to an output port to
construct system diagrams with carefully managed interdependencies.

The exposed value may be the result of an output computation, or it may
simply expose some other value contained in the Context, such as the values
of state variables. The Context handles caching of output port values and tracks
dependencies to ensure that the values are valid with respect to their
prerequisites. Leaf systems provide for the production of output port values, by
computation or forwarding from other values within the associated leaf context.
A diagram's output ports, on the other hand, are exported from output ports of
its contained subsystems.

An output port's value is always stored as an AbstractValue, but we also
provide special handling for output ports known to have numeric (vector) values.
Vector-valued ports may specify a particular vector length, or may leave that
to be determined at runtime.

%OutputPort objects support three important operations:
- Allocate() returns an object that can hold the port's value.
- Calc() unconditionally computes the port's value.
- Eval() updates a cached value if necessary.

@tparam T The vector element type, which must be a valid Eigen scalar.

Instantiated templates for the following kinds of T's are provided:
- double
- AutoDiffXd
- symbolic::Expression

They are already available to link against in the containing library.
No other values for T are currently supported. */
